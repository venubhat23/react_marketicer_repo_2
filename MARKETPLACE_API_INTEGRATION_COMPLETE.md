## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **API Service Architecture**
```javascript
// Comprehensive marketplace API service
import MarketplaceAPI, { handleApiError } from "../../services/marketplaceApi";

// Example usage:
const posts = await MarketplaceAPI.getBrandPosts({ status: 'published' });
const bid = await MarketplaceAPI.submitBid(postId, bidData);
const upload = await MarketplaceAPI.uploadMedia(file, 'image');
```

### **Error Handling Strategy**
```javascript
// Graceful error handling with fallback
try {
  const response = await MarketplaceAPI.getMarketplaceFeed();
  setMarketplacePosts(response.data.posts);
} catch (error) {
  // Fallback to mock data if API fails
  const mockData = MarketplaceAPI.getMockMarketplaceData();
  setMarketplacePosts(mockData.posts);
  toast.error(handleApiError(error));
}
```

### **Loading State Management**
```javascript
// Comprehensive loading states
const [postsLoading, setPostsLoading] = useState(false);
const [bidsLoading, setBidsLoading] = useState(false);
const [uploading, setUploading] = useState(false);

// Usage in components
{postsLoading ? <SkeletonLoader /> : <PostsList />}
```
